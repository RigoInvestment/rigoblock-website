These funds operate in an autonomous way, controlled by a private key or by another smart contract. The RigoBlock protocol is built in a modular and abstracted way, so that developers can bring their own "asset management" version to the protocol as long as they follow some basic guidelines. We created the first two classes of funds: Vaults and Dragos. A Vault allows for safe Ether hot-storage. A Drago allows for trading on decentralized exchanges.

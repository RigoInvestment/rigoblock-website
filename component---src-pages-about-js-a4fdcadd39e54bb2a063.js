The RigoBlock protocol is built in a modular and abstracted way, so that developers can bring their own "asset management version" to the protocol as long as they follow some basic guidelines. We have created the first two classes of funds: Vault and Drago. A Vault allows for safe Ether hot-storage. A Drago allows for trading on decentralized exchanges.
